# koko-aio-presets-and-overlays
Custom made slang presets and modified overlays to be used with koko-aio shader in RetroArch.

**How to use:**
- You can either download my whole repo as ZIP or go to [releases](https://github.com/Starman99x/koko-aio-presets-and-overlays/releases) and pick a pack of your choice (more to come).
- Unpack "**koko-aio_packs**" folder to: "**RetroArch/shaders**".
- The RetroArch aspect ratio must be set to FULL in settings/video/scaling.
- Obviously, disable Overlays if enabled (they'll cover up the shader).
- Load a shader preset and go.
- That's all.

The following are **experimental presets** that combine koko-aio with gdapt for Sega Genesis, this is ideal for those who want transparency effects in their Genesis/MegaDrive games, but also want them to look sharp, since the only other optioin is using Blargg's NTSC filters (try them in Genesis Plus GX Core Options/Video):


**gdapt ON**

**gdapt OFF**

As for SNES transparency, I highly recommend using the Hi-Res Blending (Merge) feature in Snes9x core options.
